      <h1>Marcos` Interests</h1>
      <h2>Why do I want to know Marcos` Interests?</h2>
      <p>Maybe you are asking yourself now "Why do I want know about Marcos` Interests? But I`ll answer you with another question. Do you already ask yourself if you really know you? The process of self learning isn`t so easy as the way we see in movies or somewhere else. For some people, it envolves a lot of time alone thinking and trying to break free from other people influences. This what I did. After that, I know now what I really like and what I want to do. I hope that I can help you, with my example, find a way to know yourself better."</p>
      <h2> What I like to do? </h2>
      <p>There are a bunch of things that I like to do. Starting with simple things like reading books, watching movies, listening songs, playing videogames in my free times, and going to more elaborated things (not that the previous ones couldn`t be it for some people) as traveling, camping, play a song on the guitar with gathered with my friends at the light of a camp fire. However, as I love reading, I graduated in Portuguese and English languages in College, so Literature and Linguistics studies are party of my life and I really love studying and knowing more about those subjects. As a consequence, watching movies, and, of course reading books, got a new meaning for me that makes it occupy most of my time. So, I`ll share with you some of my favorites movies with you.</p>
      <h2>Movies</h2>
      <p> Studing about Literature theory and Linguistics, I noticed that the cinema is a rich and beautiful area to analyse language and the way this language is shown on the screen. I like movies that attract and hold you attention. It doesn`t need to have good special effects, a lot of action or be a expensive production, that`s only necessary have a good idea with a good development. So, the movies that got my affection are.</p>
      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m8e-FF8MsqU"><em><b>Matrix (1999), by Lana & Lilly Wachowski</b></em></a></h3>

      <p>This is my favorite movie of all. Actually, I watched this for the first time when I was a 10 years old kid, and I really freaked out when I saw the fighting scenes. They looked so real for me (respect the technology level of the time!). But, one of the most important things is the plot of the movie that was so perceptive and penetrating as much it is today that, with a help of a good script, is making still a whole generation ask about the reality and the decisions we taking in our lives.</p>
      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KnrRy6kSFF0"><em><b>Inglorious Basterds (2009), by Quentin Tarantino</b></em></a></h3>

      <p><em>Theatrical release poster</em></p>
      
      <p>Talking about scripts, this movie has the most incredibles speechs I`ve ever seen. Starting with the called 'basterds', a group of American Jews who hunt Nazis (ironic), and ending with the 'villain', the Colonel Hans Landa, a nazi that at the same that he`s dangerous he`s hillarious. If you are looking for good actors with good interpratations, this is the right movie to watch.</p>
  
      <h3><a target="_blank" href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eTjHiQKJUDY><em><b>Aladdin (1992), by Ron Clements, John Musker</b></em></a></h3>

      <p>Yes, I love animations and already watched so many that usually when someone wants a good recommendation I am the person to ask for. Aladdin is my favorite Disney animation, for me everything is good, the songs, scenes, story, collors, everything! So, if you never watched it, you must do it hurry.
        
      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rPeGaos7DB4"><em><b>Donnie Darko (2001), by Richard Kelly</b></em></a></h3>

   <p><em>Theatrical release poster</em></p>
      <p>I love hard understading movies, because they make me think about theories and clues that could help to answer some questions. Donnie Darko is one of those movies. Actually, I already watched so many times there are still some things I didn`t understand. That`s what attracts me!!!
        
      <h3><a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxLHP2IpBXw"><em><b>A Ghost Story (2017), by David Lowery</b></em></a></h3>

      <p>This is the last, but not less important, movie os my list top 5 list. It isn`t a movie so well known by the big public, but it has a good idea that was executated in a reflective way that, at the same time that shocks you, makes you think about your life. The movie tells about ghost that stalks her alive wife and her grieving proccess, but it doesn`t stop there. The production invites to imagine how would be a perspective of a eternal being about the time and life. I just know that I watched this movie a lot of times and always when i finish, I still want to watch everything again.</p>
      <h2>So, what now?</h2>
      <p>This is me and what I like to do. I don't know if you identified yourself with something, But the question I want to stay in your mind: "What do you like to do?"</p>
      <p>Bye!</p>
